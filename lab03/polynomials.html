        <h1>Polynomials</h1>
        <p>If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Constant</dt>
                <dd>Constant polynomials have the form a.</dd>
            <dt>Linear</dt>
                <dd>Linear polynomials have the form a &times; x + b.</dd>
            <dt>Quadratic</dt>
                <dd>Quadratic polynomials have the form a &times; x<sup>2</sup> + b &times; x + c.</dd>
            <dt>Cubic</dt>
                <dd>Cubic polynomials have the form a &times; x<sup>3</sup> + b &times; x<sup>2</sup> + c &times; x + d.</dd>
